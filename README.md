# 1) Put the files on your computer via Git
Make sure you have git installed on your computer. Download via https://git-scm.com/install/.

Add files to computer using command below (DO THIS ONLY ONCE)
```git
git pull https://github.com/RavAstom/Meals4Health
```

# 2) Upload the files to the repository

First add the files you want to upload.
```git
git add .
```

Then commit the files. (A text editor may open, read instructions as follows)
```git
git commit
```

Finally push it to the repository
```git
git push
```

# 3) Fetching from the respository
The repository may have updated by me, and so the files on your computer are now outdated because I pushed some code to the repo :P lol sorry.

To make sure that you have the same files in the repository as you do in ur PC just put
```
git fetch
```
DO THIS BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON UR CODE TO AVOID CODING CONFLICTS BUT ILL TRY MY BEST TO TELL YOU WHEN TO FETCH THE REPO

# 4) COMPILE
```bash
gcc main.c -Wall -std=c99 -o ./a
```

Or if you have make installed on computer (not important)

```
make
```
